# suwo: A package to streamline bioacoustic analysis

The suwo package aims to simplify the retrieval of nature media (mostly
photos, audio files and videos) across multiple online biodiversity
databases. The five major media repositories accessed by this package
(GBIF, iNaturalist, Macaulay Library, WikiAves, and Xeno-Canto)
collectively host more than 250 million media files. Such media are
increasingly used in diverse fields, ranging from ecology and
evolutionary biology (e.g., trait evolution) to wildlife monitoring and
conservation (e.g., for training species detection models). The ability
to access and download large amounts of media files and their associated
metadata from a single interface thus provides a uniquely powerful
resource for facilitating research and conservation efforts.

## Details

The main features of the package are:

- Obtaining media metadata from online repositories

- Downloading associated media files

- Updating data sets with new records
