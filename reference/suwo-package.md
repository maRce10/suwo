# suwo: A package to streamline bioacoustic analysis

suwo is intended to facilitate the search of biological observation data
across multiple databases

## Details

The main features of the package are:

- The use of loops to apply tasks through acoustic signals referenced in
  a selection table

- The production of images in the working folder with spectrograms that
  allow to organize data and verify acoustic analyzes

The package offers functions to:

- Explore and download observational data from iNaturalist, GBIF,
  Macaulay Library, Observation.org, Wikiaves and Xenocanto.

- Download different types of data across multiple databases

- Consolidate databases and annotation tables

Most of the functions allow the parallelization of tasks, which
distributes the tasks among several processors to improve computational
efficiency. Tools to evaluate the performance of the analysis at each
step are also available. In addition, warbleR satisfies the need for
rigorous open source bioacoustic analysis, which facilitates
opportunities for use in research and innovation of additional custom
analyzes.
