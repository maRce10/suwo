\usage{
find_duplicates(
  metadata,
  sort = TRUE,
  criteria = paste("country > 0.8", "locality > 0.5", "user_name > 0.8", "time == 1",
    "date == 1", sep = " & "),
  verbose = getOption("suwo_verbose", TRUE)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{metadata}{data frame obtained from combining the output metadata of
two or more suwo query function using the \code{merge_metadata()} function.
Data frames obtained from a single suwo query function can also be used
but duplicates are not really expected within the same repository. The data
frame must have the following columns: \code{user_name}, \code{locality}, \code{repository},
\code{country}, \code{format}, \code{time}, and \code{date}.}

\item{sort}{Logical argument indicating if the output data frame should be
sorted by the \code{duplicate_group} column added by this function. This will
group all potential duplicates together in the output data frame.
Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{criteria}{A character string indicating the criteria to use to
determine duplicates. By default, the criteria is set to
\code{country > 0.8 & locality > 0.5 & user_name > 0.8 & time == 1
& date == 1}
which means that two entries will be considered duplicates if they have a
country similarity greater than 0.8, locality similarity greater than 0.5,
user_name similarity greater than 0.8, and exact matches for time and date
(similarities range from 0 to 1). These values have been found to work well
in most cases. Users can modify this string to adjust the sensitivity of the
duplicate detection based on their specific needs.}

\item{verbose}{Logical argument that determines if text is shown in
console. Default is \code{TRUE}. Can be set globally for the current R
session via the "suwo_verbose" option
( \code{options(suwo_verbose = TRUE)}).}
}
\value{
A data frame with the input data frame and an additional column
named \code{duplicate_group} indicating potential duplicates with a common index.
Entries without potential duplicates are labeled as \code{NA} in this new column.
}
\description{
\code{find_duplicates} detect possible duplicated entries from merged
metadata from several repositories.
}
\details{
This function compares the information in the entries of a
combined metadata data frame (typically the output of
\code{\link[=merge_metadata]{merge_metadata()}}) and labels those possible duplicates with
a common index in a new column named \code{duplicate_group}. The comparison is
based on the similarity of the following fields: \code{user_name}, \code{locality},
\code{time} and \code{country}. Only rows with no missing data for those fields will
be considered. The function uses the \code{RecordLinkage} package to perform the
a fuzzy matching comparison and identify potential duplicates based on
predefined similarity thresholds (see argument 'criteria'). The function
only spots duplicates from different repositories and assumes those
duplicates should have the same \code{format} and \code{date}. This function is
useful for curating the data obtained by merging data from multiple sources,
as the same observation might be recorded in different repositories.
This is a common issue in citizen science repositories, where users might
upload the same observation to different platforms. This can also occur as
some repositories automatically share data with other repositories,
particularly with GBIF.

\examples{
# get metadata from 2 repos
gb <- query_gbif(species = "Turdus rufiventris", format =  "sound")
inat <- query_inaturalist(species = "Turdus rufiventris",
  format = "sound")

# run if queries didnt fail
 if (!is.null(gb) && !is.null(inat)) {
# combine metadata
merged_metadata <- merge_metadata(inat, gb)

# find duplicates
label_dup_metadata <- find_duplicates(metadata = merged_metadata)
