\usage{
query_inaturalist(
  species = getOption("species"),
  cores = getOption("mc.cores", 1),
  pb = getOption("pb", TRUE),
  verbose = getOption("verbose", TRUE),
  format = c("sound", "image"),
  identified = FALSE,
  verifiable = FALSE,
  all_data = getOption("all_data", FALSE),
  raw_data = getOption("raw_data", FALSE)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{species}{Character string with the scientific name of a species in the format: "Genus epithet". Required. Can be set globally for the current R session via the "term" option (e.g. \code{options(term = "Hypsiboas rufitelus")}).}

\item{cores}{Numeric vector of length 1. Controls whether parallel computing is applied by specifying the number of cores to be used. Default is 1 (i.e. no parallel computing). Can be set globally for the current R session via the "mc.cores" option (e.g.  \code{options(mc.cores = 2)}). Note that some repositories might not support parallel queries from the same IP address as it might be identified as denial-of-service cyberattack.}

\item{pb}{Logical argument to control if progress bar is shown. Default is \code{TRUE}. Can be set globally for the current R session via the "pb" option ( \code{options(pb = TRUE)}).}

\item{verbose}{Logical argument that determines if text is shown in console. Default is \code{TRUE}. Can be set globally for the current R session via the "verbose" option ( \code{options(verbose = TRUE)}).}

\item{format}{Character vector with the media format to query for. Currently 'image' and 'sound' are available.}

\item{identified}{Logical argument to define if search results are categorized as identified by inaturalist.}

\item{verifiable}{Logical argument to define if search results are categorized as verifiable by inaturalist.}

\item{all_data}{Logical argument that determines if all data available from database is shown in the results of search. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{raw_data}{Logical argument that determines if the raw data from the API is returned (e.g. without any manipulation). Default is \code{FALSE}. Can be set globally for the current R session via the "raw_data" option ( \code{options(raw_data = TRUE)}). If \code{TRUE}  \code{all_data} is set to \code{TRUE} internally. Useful for developers, or if users suspect that some data is mishandled during processing (i.e. date information is lost). Note that the metadata obtained when \code{raw_data = TRUE} is not standardized, so most suwo functions for downstream steps will not work on them.}
}
\value{
The function returns a data frame with the metadata of the media files matching the search criteria. If \code{all_data = TRUE}, all metadata fields (columns) are returned. If \code{raw_data = TRUE}, the raw data as obtained from the repository is returned (without any formatting).
